# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This is my submission for the project 0 . In this website i have implemented all that i had learned in lectures to create a portfolio website. In this i used bootstrap for table and navbar with some styling changes of my own. 
I used animations in this on the text so that when mouse hovers on the text it glows and grow in size.

The index page contains basic info about me with some sample images and also what i like to do.

The next page is abou my techinal knowledge where i described all knowledge of various languages which i learned along the way

After that is the page of my projects where i described some of the prjects i had made and used the float property on text to align the image and text next to each other.

The last page is about feedback where a person can write their comments and also i provided a table 
which contains my facebook profile and github profile 
I also added the capability to email me directly.

I also the made the website mobile responsive and removed the animation from small screens because it was hampering the capability of website.
